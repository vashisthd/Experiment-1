        <h4 style="font-size: 2vw; text-align: center;">India’s Largest Online Bookstore</h4><br>
        <p>Reading is considered as the most intelligent habit. Reading is intelligent but it's also enriching, soothing, escapist, inspirational, transformative and a timeless journey. The habit of reading opens the door for completely new universes which existed merely as tiny filaments in our dreams. With the transformed approach, BookChor brings you these unimaginable filaments of wonders to your doorsteps. We are a team of dedicated book enthusiasts creating a dream from 2015 and working to deliver the dream to every book lover in India. Through our journey we have developed an app to make the book purchase easy. We have held events all over the nation which witnessed a gathering of thousands of book lovers. We sell new books, old and used books, rare and limited editions, everything under a single platform. We also provide you with an opportunity to sell us books instead of letting them rot at the bottom of your bookshelf, in return for more books.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 2vw; text-align: center;">Our Vision</h4>
            <p>In 2015, Bookchor embarked on a mission close to our heart – to revolutionize the way we read books in India. We are amazed by the leaps we've made and the community we have built. Bookchor is not just a company; it’s a revolution that is happening to transform the mind and hearts of readers.
                
                From our humble beginnings, we've become the first online platform in India dedicated to the sale of used and second-hand books. Apart from selling books online, our offline events have become vivid celebrations of the literary arts, bringing readers together with authors to share their passion
                
                Our vision at Bookchor is audacious yet simple – to ignite the love for reading within the Indian youth. We aim to spark curiosity, making quality literature accessible to all. Our vision extends beyond selling books; it's about making our country 'literally wise again.'
                
                The core of our mission is affordability. We do not tolerate the idea of a book enthusiast walking away from a book just because it was expensive. Bookchor strives to make quality books affordable for everyone. The best knowledge must be affordable to the last person and we are all set to achieve our mission.
                
                As we continue this literary crusade, I invite you to join hands with the Bookchor vision. Let's make India a nation that reads, learns, and grows together, one beautiful book at a time</p>
